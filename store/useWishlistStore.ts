/**
 * Wishlist, guest-first.
 *
 * It used to be server-only: toggling while logged out threw, and the button
 * bounced you to /login. That's a lot of friction for "save this for later",
 * so the list now lives in localStorage and works on the first tap with no
 * account at all.
 *
 * When an account IS present the server stays the source of truth, and the two
 * are reconciled by union rather than overwrite:
 *  - `load()` merges the server's ids into whatever is stored locally, so
 *    something saved as a guest survives logging in;
 *  - `mergeIntoAccount()` runs after login/register and pushes anything local
 *    up to the server;
 *  - `toggle()` writes locally first and syncs in the background, so a logged
 *    -out toggle is a success rather than an error.
 *
 * Ids are held as an array internally (JSON-serialisable, so `persist` works
 * without a custom reviver) but exposed as a Set via `ids`, which is the shape
 * the existing components already read.
