/**
 * Who is placing this order, and where is it going?
 *
 * Both checkout routes (COD-era /api/orders and the Razorpay create-order)
 * needed the same two answers, and getting either subtly different between them
 * is how you end up with orders that skip a validation one path enforces. So
 * the logic lives here once.
 *
 * Two identities are accepted:
 *  - `user`  — a real session (NextAuth or the JWT cookie), as before.
 *  - `guest` — a verified phone, proved by the signed guest token that
 *              /api/auth/otp/verify sets. No account, no password, 30 minutes.
 *
 * The guest phone is read from the *signed token*, never from the request body.
 * That distinction is the whole security model: a client can put any phone
 * number in a JSON payload, but it cannot forge a token signed with
 * JWT_ACCESS_SECRET. The number attached to the order is therefore always one
 * that someone demonstrably received an SMS on — which is what makes a guest
 * order traceable, and what a guest later uses to look the order up.
